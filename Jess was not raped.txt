@jessphillips  Could you give examples of these 'rape threats' or have you just got a very vivid imagination like most leftist feminists?
@FrequentDeleter @jessphillips I've followed it since Sunday and nobody has saw any evidence of a rape threat
@Joecphillips @jessphillips Sargon can't account for crazy people.  If Sargon ever said to me, "I would never rape you," I'd say, "Thanks!"
@FrequentDeleter @jessphillips apparently what they said is a rape threat according to uk media

@jessphillips You think people telling you they won't rape you is harassment? I got ten times as bad when I was 15, and I didn't fall apart.
@jessphillips Even if I were into girls, I still wouldn't rape you, Jess. &lt;3
@Fifthcolumnblue @jessphillips just like everyone said to her I will not rape you
But good to know you don't care about the issues it raises
@Joecphillips @jessphillips I'm a man - and I believe the idea of "International Men's Day" is rather pathetic. I presume you won't rape me
@Joecphillips @jessphillips others threatened to rape you were just obnoxious by saying you wouldn't
@Fifthcolumnblue @jessphillips it was a response to her article saying people always threaten to rape her, the reply was I wouldn't
@Joecphillips @jessphillips so rape isn't a threat????

@jessphillips you are a lying, manipulative, anti wight, anti male bigot of the highest order. No one said you are Unworthy of rape liar!

@jessphillips brilliant
@matt_dathan 1/ blatantly untrue story featuring @jessphillips in today's mail. No one tweeted her threatening to rape her
@jessphillips It's no more offensive than someone stating that they wouldn't rape anyone. But you know that don't you. Victim bux ftw
@wheneverisit1 @birminghammail @jessphillips No-one threatened her with rape, check her mentions yourself, the evidence is there to see.
@sehwyn_doron Maybe you're as ignorant of what 'fair comment' means as you are of what's 'pro-rape'.
@Glinner @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips
@skepticosaurus @buchanan17 @Joecphillips @jessphillips Interesting that she is where you put your time &amp; energy, not the rape apologists

@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips
@NBlondon @jessphillips @politicshome the article is a lie no one made a rape threat they responded in a way she did not like to an article

@tezzylivey @jessphillips I would rather that mentality was eradicated to change this culture. Immigration is not to blame #rape #feminism
@BettyLaG1 @jessphillips so u would rather men say they WOULD rape u? Then hang around in Rotherham a cologne love. Ur get ur wish.
@jessphillips what the fuck??? i would NEVER rape you! how offensive!

@Chunky308 @sodiumin @jessphillips I wouldn't rape my female relatives either. Rape is bad.

@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips because idiots like you and jess think it is as serious as a rape threat
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE What threats of rape? All there is refusals to commit rape.
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips its not a rape threat though it is the exact opposite
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE Wheres the rape threat?.. He said he wouldnt rape this person
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips hold on we're talking about rape threats. Please provide examples of these rape threats
@yellowtwentyone @2dadslulz @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips I'd rape all of you

call the cops
@2dadslulz @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Why are you so keen to defend people's rights to discuss whether they would rape someone? Curious.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @yellowtwentyone @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE apparently your rape shaming is on the BBC.
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Ahhh okay so we aren't talk about harassment we ARE talking about rape threats specifically?
@BettyLaG1 @jessphillips i thought women didn't want to be raped? So why is someone saying they would NEVER rape u, a threat? Lmfao.
@2dadslulz @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Tell me now that there aren't women who receive hundreds of tweets on whether men would rape them
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips is it a MASS rape threat? Yeah nah, doesn't look like it mate
@GRIMACHU @Sargon_of_Akkad @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE why bring rape into it?
@yellowtwentyone @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips this just in, saying you WON'T rape someone, now counts as threatening to rape them!
@birminghammail @jessphillips  beyond civilised conduct.threatening women with rape the most cowardly act. show the faces of the abusers.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @yellowtwentyone @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE He's gonna link to posts with the word rape in it.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @Sharok888 @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE it's even worse for me, he didnt threaten to not rape me.
@FoxholePlays @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE Rape threats =/= disagreement
@Sargon_of_Akkad @MoAnsar @jessphillips @VictoriaLIVE So the police should ignore mass rape threats because...it's the internet?
@AllcockNick @jessphillips Donâ€™t let them rape you.
@jessphillips very much needs to be more discussed. Rape culture and abuse (in all forms) needs to be discussed. I hope people listen.
"There are idiots on the internet saying they don't want to rape me".  @jessphillips had 1000s of #abusive tweets https://t.co/w2ccQK7QPg

@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips But you're not in the skin of a woman receiving a not rape threat...
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Sargon's followers detect a lack of authenticity to almost anyone's reactions to rape jokes
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips I'm making an ethical assertion with a logical foundation: rape is not as heinous as murder
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips No, we're simply back to proportion: infanticide is infinitely worse than rape
@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips No, because you don't get to decide how much a not-rape threat bothers her.
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips you also compare rape and murder, which the latter dwarfs in heinousness
@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Then who decides what is too vile?  You?  Or the woman offended at the not rape tweet?
@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips And a not rape threat doesn't....
This is an ethical issue.  If you have to parse you've lost.
@rumdeal @birminghammail @jessphillips no she can't saying you won't rape someone isn't a crime

@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips ... alternately an adult must take a rape joke less gravely to differentiate herself from...
@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips equally so a woman might not take lightly a not rape threat.
1 or the other.  You don't get both.
@jessphillips I wouldn't rape you either.
@bogorislav @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips ...then you are only drawing that line between that a a threat to a woman to not rape her...

@Josh_Magosh @jessphillips Actually it's perfectly legal to tell someone that you aren't going to rape them. Literally nothing wrong with it
@AbdiwaliDuale @jessphillips So they have no morals...because they said they would NEVER rape her or any human being? Rape is good?

@benjaminpmoore @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips "You wouldn't rape someone? Reported!"
What are you? A rape apologist?
@Sozzinski @birminghammail @jessphillips 

So if someone makes you angry, threatening to rape them is a reasonable response?
@Sozzinski @birminghammail @jessphillips 

How do you "provoke" a rape threat?
@Beggerz @ashikenshin @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips @benjaminpmoore @Joecphillips @Glinner @Support People are saying they won't rape...
@The_Sysbit @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips rape non-threats en masse knew it or not, they were not demonstrating that trait.

@TheStevenThomas @JamesAsser @jessphillips Show her that her son has said he wouldn't rape someone.  Yeah, do that.
Could all the morons "debating" rape on @jessphillips timeline please join a queue? Victims of real rape would like to meet you in real life
@GodfreyElfwick @twitter @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Rape involves more work than it is worth. Same for consensual sex.
RT @blumpeee: @Sargon_of_Akkad how dare you prevent @jessphillips's narrative by preventing her rape.
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips being told she wouldnt be rape are equivalent then you have issues , serious ones.
@jessphillips I won't rape you Jessie. Not if you had the last shame cave on earth
@jessphillips Jess, why are you so mad at people saying that they WOULDN'T rape you? What is your major malfunction Jess?
@CoastalRoadNine @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips 2/2 and if you think stating someone wouldnt rape= killing babies you have issues big ones
@Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips how's it acceptable to say you wouldn't rape someone?

@benjaminpmoore @Joecphillips @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips He literally said that he wouldn't rape her. That's it.
@evanoconnell @jessphillips they said they would never rape her... call the police for what precisely? Being anti rape?
@benjaminpmoore @Joecphillips @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips I believe he clarified later he wouldn't rape anyone.
According to @benjaminpmoore, @Sargon_of_Akkad's valid criticism against @jessphillips's  mythical rape culture rhetoric is "harassment"

@Joecphillips @benjaminpmoore @Glinner @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips He said he wouldn't "even" rape her. Changes the entire meaning.
@benjaminpmoore @Joecphillips @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips no, he said he wouldnt rape her because rape is morally wrong
@Glinner @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips saying "rape" is harassment. Saying "I won't rape"
is harassment. Commenting on this is harassment.
@benjaminpmoore @CatlinNya @Joecphillips @Glinner @Support @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips actually he said he wouldn't rape any woman.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Don't drop the soap, big hommie. There will be no rape until it hits the ground. :)
@benjaminpmoore @Joecphillips @Glinner @jessphillips Telling someone you wouldn't rape them is targetted harassment?
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips look at it this way. It reinforces their idea that "would rape" is the default for men.
@jessphillips im a white mail from norway,and i would not rape you. and good news feminism in norway is litteraly dead. yayy:D

"Wont" hunny. People are saying they WONT rape you even if you were the last woman on earth. Stop exaggerating.
@JonnyoftheBingo @jpjanson @jessphillips That you immediately believe Jess's lie calling the tweets mocking her article "rape threats", and

Love how she is framing it as rape threats, not people affirming their intent to NOT rape for shits'n'giggles
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips I wouldn't rape her.
@jessphillips @Sargon_of_Akkad  I have never and will never rape anyone. 
I know this makes me part of the patriarchy but its just who i am.
@jessphillips lol it's ppl saying they won't rape you. How is that alarming in any way. Lol you're a delusional wreck.
I think your brain cells are dead, @jessphillips. Saying you won't rape someone is not talking about your rape. It's, in fact, the opposite.
Hey @jessphillips, I wouldn't rape you.
@buchanan17 tbh I think it is daft. But to reframe it as "talking about my rape" is disingenuous at best.

 @Joecphillips @jessphillips
@buchanan17 i believe it's just silliness, pointing out that 99% of men not rapists and have no urge to rape.

@Joecphillips @jessphillips
@buchanan17 @skepticosaurus @jessphillips  she wrote about people saying they would rape her then online then it was said I wouldn't
@Xturntodust @jessphillips I didn't see any rape threats or talking about raping her just saying they wouldn't, is not raping disgusting?
@skepticosaurus @Joecphillips @jessphillips she does write &amp; say stupid things; but where does someone saying they wouldn't rape her fit in?
@Joecphillips @jessphillips it's ok I wouldn't rape you anyway?
@buchanan17 mocking can include discussion of anything at all. And you mean "not rape" don't you. 

 @jessphillips
.@jessphillips Long live free speech. There are bigger issues than your alleged rape. I personally don't believe you &amp; most politicians

Like i said I wouldn't rape anyone
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips I wouldn't even rape you, Sargon!
@malsimons @jessphillips there is a difference between saying i won't rape someone and raping someone can you not see the difference?
@malsimons @jessphillips it was her who brought up the topic so are we supposed to ignore it when people talk about rape or not?
@malsimons @jessphillips yes I know Im such a terrible person for saying I won't rape someone, there are over 3.5 billion other women I wont
@Joecphillips @jessphillips I think the fact that you consider rape as an acceptable thing to consider says a lot. #horrible
@jessphillips I thought the tweets were about who would not rape you?
@malsimons @jessphillips yes, saying you wouldn't rape someone in response to something they have said is despicable
@Xturntodust @jessphillips so saying you won't rape someone in response to something they have said is disgusting?
@kflogan @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Rape as an event is very serious. As a topic it's like all others and doesn't need to be serious-
@savage_tina @jessphillips because she is being dishonest people said they wouldn't rape her in response to something she wrote about rape
@jessphillips Speaking of rape, I assume you know the majority of convicted rapists were abused by women. Right? https://t.co/8U0u5mzJLl
@jessphillips I wouldnt even rape you either
So there's this British MP, @jessphillips,  who is upset that people are proclaiming they WILL NOT rape her, lol.

I'd defend you by punching anyone who threatened to rape you, @jessphillips. It might not be helpful to feminism tho https://t.co/006ZOZVUyf

its kinda pleasant to know that realy

@Sargon_of_Akkad @BenDevaney @jessphillips @mrskribble Id rather rape Sargon than Jess
@Sargon_of_Akkad @BenDevaney @Kartoshkina_L @jessphillips @mrskribble now we need an anti-anti rape patriarchy brigade!
@Sargon_of_Akkad @speedy6617 @jessphillips I wouldn't rape around 7 billion people. WHAT NOW BITCH?!
@Sargon_of_Akkad @speedy6617 @jessphillips I bet you wouldn't rape a transwoman.  BIGOT!
We're anti-rape activists for the patriarchy. @BenDevaney @Kartoshkina_L @jessphillips @mrskribble
@jessphillips I wouldn't rape you either.   Not even.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @speedy6617 @jessphillips So you're saying you would rape some? GOTCHA BITCH
@mrskribble @jessphillips @Sargon_of_Akkad you can't threaten someone by saying you wouldn't rape them either.
I'm not even kidding, there are literally BILLIONS of women I wouldn't rape.  @speedy6617 @jessphillips
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips Oh no. Are you discriminating again? Who else whould you NOT rape. Smelling law suit now. Lol.
@jessphillips Saying they wouldn't rape you and you still play the victim card. That is some true dedication to victimhood right there
@Domidayv @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips
"would not rape you even if you were asking for it"

just that much of a gentleman.
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips "Oh my god someone does't want to rape oh how horrible", shouldn't this be the opposite?
@mrskribble @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips 
Jerod, I wouldn't rape you.
@jessphillips @Sargon_of_Akkad According to what feminists want for consent laws,rape could count as looking in her general direction...
@jessphillips @mrskribble @Sargon_of_Akkad "I wouldn't rape you" isn't a bad thing, just like"I wouldn't kick your head in"isn't a bad thing
If you were the last woman on earth, I still would not rape you, @JessPhillips. (Note: this misogyny came from my wife).
If you find people telling you they won't rape you offensive, you might be an idiot. @jessphillips
@lukeeholland97 @Albino3Viper @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips you must be a fan of rape since you promote diversity
@Albino3Viper @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips you lot obviously have such a shit life, tweeting someone on a Sunday night about rape
@WayneGoldPig @Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips 
who have I accused of rape?
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips
Isn't that a good thing?

"I wouldn't rape you."
"Thanks, I appreciate it."

???
@Sargon_of_Akkad @jessphillips 
Its good to see that sargon takes rape 'so seriously'!
I wouldn't even rape you, @jessphillips. #AntiRapeThreats  #FeminismIsCancer https://t.co/T3TZeHRXQU
@3075John @jessphillips I think the Internet would be a safer place without rape threats tbh John but thanks for your input í ½í¸Š
#feminism #rape #misandry #bigotry @YvetteCooperMP @jessphillips  https://t.co/U4uvFLROda
https://t.co/HglTTGZkX3 It's not just the Brazilian media that excuse rape. @jessphillips did the exact same thing on UK TV recently
@jessphillips WELL OF COURSE UR THE ESTABLISHMENT, UR A RICH MP, THOUGHT U WUD HELP CHILD RAPE VICTIMS, BUT U LET THEM DOWN, SO SAD
@jessphillips know this: for every rape threat, intimidation, accusation &amp; general dickhead - there's at least 5 people admiring your effort
@pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers I wasnt excited listening to Helen's #Rape I was hyper-ventilating because there was NO #BBC warning
@pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers So will there be jollies for all #Rape #Survivors triggered by Helen's #Rape with no #BBC warning?
@womensaid @pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers So let me see #Rape Survivors think it is OK to land a #Rape scene without #CONSENT Really?
@womensaid @pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers Re-Traumatising #Rape #Survivors GREAT JOB! [NOT] but hey #BBC doesnt care
@womensaid @pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers AND buying in2 the @BBCRadio4 Myth that #Rape #Survivors R4 listeners do not actually EXIST
@womensaid @pollyn1 @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers nobody listened to mine. NIL pre-warning of #RAPE scenes means that you are NOT THINKING
@womensaid @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers listening to Helen clearly being #Rape-d was appalling &amp; v triggering but @BBCRadio4 gave no warning
@womensaid @jessphillips @BBCTheArchers &amp; @BBCWomansHour who dont deal with anything other than crude stereotypes of #Rape #Survivors
@womensaid @jessphillips Simply no excuse4 @BBCTheArchers NOT placing #Rape warnings IN ADVANCE so that #Rape #Survivors NOT re-traumatised
